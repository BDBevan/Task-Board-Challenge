# Task Board Challenge 
This is my initial task board page. It allows users to create tasks via a pop-up modal, assign a due date via a date picker, and then allows the user to move the tasks through each development swim lane as the development cycle(s) are performed.
Please see a list of features, screenshots and links to both the published page and repo below. 


## Features

- Allows users to create new tasks via a pop-up modal when the 'add task' button is clicked.
- Allows for task title, description and task due date via date picker.
- Urgent tasks are back ground colour coded in red, med are colour coded in yellow, low priority are in white.
- The user can delete each newly created task via a button on the cards.
- The user can drag and drop each card into each individual development swimlane(s) depending on the status of the item.
